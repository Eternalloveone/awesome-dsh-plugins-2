name: dsh-topic-curator
description: Scan the GitHub `dsh-plugin` topic for new DeepSeek Harness community extensions, diff them against the local catalog CSVs, dispatch parallel review agents, and merge qualifying repos (above the star floor) into repositories.csv / dsh-plugin-topic-candidates.csv / verified-plugins.csv per the project's curation rules. This skill should be used when the user asks to refresh, sync, or "添砖加瓦" the DSH plugin catalog from the GitHub topic, or to audit newly tagged repos.

# DSH Topic Curator

Keep `data/repositories.csv`, `data/dsh-plugin-topic-candidates.csv`,
`data/audit-results.csv`, and `data/verified-plugins.csv` in sync with the GitHub
`dsh-plugin` topic, adding only genuine, qualifying extensions and respecting the
star floor.

## When to use

- The user asks to scan / refresh / sync the `dsh-plugin` GitHub topic into the catalog.
- The user reports "the topic has new repos" and wants them vetted and merged.
- Periodic catalog maintenance ("继续扫", "再扫一轮").

## Workflow

### 1. Collect topic repos (gh Search API, paginated)

- The `dsh-plugin` topic exploded to **~10,600 repos** (2026-08; 9923 of them were
  `pushed` in 2026-08 alone). It is far too big for WebFetch pagination (~260 pages).
- **Search API hard cap:** every query returns at most **1000 results**
  (`page=11` → HTTP 422 "Only the first 1000 search results are available"). A single
  `sort=stars` query therefore only ever sees the top-1000-by-stars — missing the
  ~9,900 long-tail repos where genuine new small plugins hide.
- **Full-coverage scan (recommended):** use
  `scripts/full_topic_scan.py`. It partitions the topic into disjoint sub-queries
  (star tiers for `>10`, then the `stars:<=10` remainder split by `created:` year
  through 2024 and month from 2025 onward —
  single-sided `created:YYYY` / `created:YYYY-MM`; an overflowing period is split into its days and a
  day into 24 adjacent hour buckets) so every leaf is fully
  retrievable, then dedupes by repo name. Outputs both a rich JSON and a
  `diff_topic.py`-compatible `{name, stars}` list.
- `python3 scripts/full_topic_scan.py --dry-run` → print the partition plan + counts.
- `python3 scripts/full_topic_scan.py --execute` → fetch everything (rate-limited,
  ~9 min; run Bash with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`).
- `python3 scripts/full_topic_scan.py --execute --actionable-only` → fetch only the
  six disjoint `>10`-star tiers used by the daily curator run.
- `--only ">500,11..20"` / `--since 2026-06` to scope a run.
- Writes lean `{name, stars}` arrays to `/tmp/dsh_topic_full.json` and
  `/tmp/dsh_topic_repos.json` (compat).
- Writes `/tmp/dsh_topic_scan_summary.json`; continue only when `coverage_ok` is
  strictly `true` and both `failures` and `over_cap` are empty. The summary is
  invalidated at the start of every run, so never trust an older file.
  - **GOTCHA (measured 2026-08-23):** day-level `created:A..B` is END-INCLUSIVE —
    `created:2026-08-13..2026-08-14` = 522 + 1702 = both days. Never write a day
    range with a different END day; query a single day as `D..D`, a month as
    single-sided `YYYY-MM`, and hours as adjacent buckets `T00..T01, T01..T02, ...`.
- **Quick top-1000 only (legacy):** if you only want the popular slice,
  `gh api "search/repositories?q=topic:dsh-plugin&sort=stars&order=desc&per_page=100&page=N" --jq '.items[] | {name: .full_name, stars: .stargazers_count}'`
  for N=1..10, then `jq -s . > topic_repos.json`. The diff script's star floor makes
  deeper pages irrelevant for curation.
- Dedupe by lowercased name (the topic occasionally repeats a repo).

### 2. Diff against the catalog

- Run `scripts/diff_topic.py <topic_repos.json> --catalog-dir data --star-floor 10`.
  - Default floor = `10`: repos with `stars <= 10` are skipped (per "10 个 star 内的先不处理").
    To include 10-star repos, pass `--star-floor 9`.
  - The script reports NEW repos (absent from both `repositories.csv` and
    `dsh-plugin-topic-candidates.csv`), split into `above_floor` (to process) and
    `skipped` (below floor). It also writes `/tmp/dsh_new_repos.json`.

### 3. Dispatch parallel review agents

- Split `above_floor` into batches of at most 6 repositories and run at most 3 review
  agents concurrently. Each agent must follow `references/agent-prompt.md`, inspect
  metadata/fork status, README, `package.json`, DSH/Cordis manifests or SKILL entry,
  and the exact install path. Agents MUST NOT modify project files.
- Each agent writes one top-level JSON array to `/tmp/dsh_review_batch_N.json`, with
  exactly one object per input repository. Wait for every batch and stop on any
  missing, malformed, or failed result.

### 4. Classify & place each repo

Use `references/curation-criteria.md` (mirrors `data/curation-criteria.yaml`, the source of
truth) and `references/csv-schema.md`:

- `verdict` ∈ {verified_plugin, verified_skill, watchlist, related, rejected}
- `MAIN_DIR = yes` ONLY when there is a real DSH load path: native Cordis bundle, a
  documented `dsh plugin --profile` command, a `cordis.patch.yml` mount, or skills
  installed into `~/.dsh`. Aggregate lists (awesome-lists), desktop shells / launchers,
  forks of the core harness itself, and non-DSH plugins (e.g. Claude Code plugins) go to the
  **candidate list only** (`related` / `watchlist`) — never `repositories.csv`.
- Repos with a native DSH load path: add to `repositories.csv` (main) **and**
  `verified-plugins.csv`.
- All newly discovered repos: add a row to `dsh-plugin-topic-candidates.csv` and
  `audit-results.csv` with the review verdict.

### 5. Merge (validate before publishing)

- Run `python3 scripts/merge_audit_verdicts.py --topic-repos /tmp/dsh_new_repos.json
  /tmp/dsh_review_batch_*.json`.
- The script must verify that review repositories exactly equal `above_floor`, reject
  duplicate or conflicting primary keys, and atomically publish all four CSVs after
  staging/validation. It writes `/tmp/dsh_merge_summary.json` and leaves a unique
  backup directory when rows change.
- Continue only when the summary has `ok: true`; never hand-edit or append CSVs.

### 5b. Regenerate documentation

- After promoting verified verdicts into `data/verified-plugins.csv`, run
  `python3 scripts/aggregate.py --render-only` and
  `python3 scripts/generate_docs.py --strict`. The first command renders the
  aggregate catalog offline; the second regenerates the README index (a compact
  navigation index that links out to the category pages) and the `docs/categories/*.md`
  category pages (each holding the FULL listing of verified repos in that category). It
  also refreshes the verified-count badge and the snapshot date. The README and
  `docs/categories/` structure follows the companion site's 22 categories (ids match
  `https://deepseekharnessplugins.com/plugins/category/<id>`); the CSV `category` slug is
  mapped to those categories via `SLUG_MAP` in `scripts/generate_docs.py`. Stop if
  the generator reports any unmapped category.

### 6. Log

- Append the date, daily/weekly mode, coverage, floor, above-floor count, verdict
  counts, table row additions, backup directory, and verification result to the
  tracked `.workbuddy/memory/MEMORY.md`.

## Notes / gotchas

- Topic pages can duplicate repos across pages, and WebFetch star counts are approximate —
  dedupe and treat the floor as a guideline, not gospel.
- Most topic repos are already catalogued; expect a low new-repo rate. The value is
  confirming completeness, not bulk-adding.
- Do NOT describe a project as secure / official / audited / production-ready without strong
  primary evidence (`review_policy` in the criteria).
- Re-check entries after DSH breaking releases, since the ecosystem is in developer preview.
